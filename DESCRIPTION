Description: Uses non-linear regression to statistically compare two circadian rhythms.
    Groups are only compared if both are rhythmic (amplitude is non-zero).
    Performs analyses regarding mesor, phase, and amplitude, reporting on estimates and statistical differences, for each, between groups.
    Details can be found in Parsons et al (2020) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz730>.
